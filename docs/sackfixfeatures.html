<p>They share a common session layer implementation and state machine with the following features:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Full implementation of the session level protocol</li>
    <li>Generated strongly typed immutable field and business messages for all versions of fix</li>
    <li>A code generator which sources the XML from the Quickfix4j dictionaries - you can
    edit the XML and add your own fields if you have to extend the spec.</li>
    <li>Unknown fields are preserved within the message as untyped pairs.</li>
    <li>Injectable message store - you could replace with your own</li>
    <li>Default message store is file based, supporting replay of business messages</li>
    <li>Injectable business class which can forward messages to your own actor</li>
    <li>Notification of business class that the session is open, closed (the business class
      is a class which you write)</li>
    <li>Notification of business class that messages are rejected</li>
    <li>Automatic reset of sequence numbers at the start of each day</li>
    <li>Ability to reset sequence numbers in application.conf to resynch after issues</li>
    <li>Multiple configures sessions, running in parallel</li>
    <li>Actor for IO, decoding, session maintenance, latency recording (optional)</li>
    <li>Logging of state change (using logback)</li>
    <li>Optional logging of every raw fix message to its own file (via logback)</li>
    <li>Optional logging of human readable fix message to it own file (via logback)</li>
    <li>With less logging average times to process a business message once the session is
    established is 300 to 500 microseconds, or 3 ms with full logging (on a small i5 laptop)</li>
    <li>There is a normal level of GC and this is obviously not low latency</li>
    <li>Automatic wake and sleep by config in application.conf</li>
  </ul>

<p>Part of writing a fix engine is finding out how exactly fix should work.  The
best spec I found was the test spec, and from this an entirely seperate project
was created containing all the session level tests - check out the
sackfixtests project.</p>

<p>So, what is missing?  The following have not been implemented, and I am not
going to, as this is not a commercial project, this is a learning project.
You could add these features if you need them - donâ€™t be scared to open the
code and change it.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Login by username and password in a session</li>
    <li>Encryption</li>
    <li>Multiple fix versions (jars) in a single JVM - you would need a classloader
    per session/group of sessions</li>
    <li>On receipt it does not enforce strict ordering of fields in groups which
    is what the spec says.  On sending the order is correct.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Sackfix was written to learn Scala and Akka with a real world problem.</p>
