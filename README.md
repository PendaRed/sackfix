# SackFix

A Fix implementation developed as a Scala training excercise.  It is a full implementation of the session level
protocol, tested using an sackfix tester, supporting acceptor and initiators using AKKA and Scala.
Hope you find it useful.

## Versions

JDK 1.8, Scala 2.11, SBT 0.13.12, Akka 2.4.16.   Feel free to upgrade.

## What is this project?

This project contains the core code generator and the common fields and message definitions which makes the session layer tick.

You should really have no need to checkout this project unless you want to change the code generator.   All documentation is at [sackfix.org](http://www.sackfix.org/).

## I want to build it anyway

Check it out and use sbt.

Best wishes,
Jonathan
